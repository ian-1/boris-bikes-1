User stories:

As a person,
So that I can use a bike,
I'd like a docking station to release a bike.

As a person,
So that I can use a good bike,
I'd like to see if a bike is working

As a member of the public
So I can return bikes I've hired
I want to dock my bike at the docking station

As a member of the public
So I can decide whether to use the docking station
I want to see a bike that has been docked

As a member of the public,
So that I am not confused and charged unnecessarily,
I'd like docking stations not to release bikes when there are none available.

 ## Errors

 ```
NameError: uninitialized constant DockingStation
    from (irb):2
    from /home/ec2-user/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.6.3/bin/irb:23:in `<main>'
```

irb line 2 states :
```
docking_station = DockingStation.new
```
This is a problem because the constant 'DockingStation' does not yet exist, or in code speak it has not been initialized.

We could solve this error by creating a constant called 'DockingStation'.
